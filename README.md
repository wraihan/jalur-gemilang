# Jalur-Gemilang


Jalur Gemilang (Flag of Malaysia) drawn in ConTeXt (LUAMETATEX engine).

Files' processing is automated with the help of scripts provided by Dave Jarvis in his [blog posts](https://dave.autonoma.ca/blog/) chiefly titled '**Typesetting Markdown**' (from Part 1 to 8).
1. Place `build-template` into `~/bin` directory (make sure the PATH environment variable is set); &
2. Run `ci` script (which I modified to suit my needs) inside each project directory with the command below:
```
./ci -V
```
